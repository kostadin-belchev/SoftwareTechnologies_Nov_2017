                            </header>

                            <p>
                                Anyone who tries to tell you that the “X” cryptocurrency is the absolute best cryptocurrency to invest in, probably has a very large vested interest in it.
                                In reality, there are will mostly likely be several big winners in cryptocurrency. It's like the dot com boom, where companies like Microsoft, Oracle and Google ultimately became blockbuster investments.
                                But you only made money in those investments, if you understood why they were good investments AND you had a reason to keep those investments for the long term.
                                Otherwise there would have been a big temptation to sell them as soon as you made a little bit of profit.
                                If you don't understand what a cryptocurrency does or why it's valuable, then don't invest in it. Many of these cryptocurrencies are going to be a passing fad.
